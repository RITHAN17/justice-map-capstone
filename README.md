## 1. 🎯 Problem Statement and Value Proposition

### The Problem: The Critical Barrier to Justice

The pursuit of justice for millions of citizens is blocked by **legal illiteracy and language barriers**. Current digital portals are complex, excluding low-literacy, vernacular-first users from accessing free legal aid services (NALSA). This forces the most vulnerable to suffer injustice (e.g., wage theft) or rely on costly, unreliable intermediaries.

### The Solution: JusticeMap AI Avatar

**JusticeMap** is a specialized, **Voice-First, Vernacular AI Agent** designed to eliminate this barrier. It uses a **Multi-Agent Architecture** to fully automate the initial intake and documentation process for claims like Wage Theft.

### Value Proposition (The AI Efficiency Multiplier)

* **Equity and Access:** The voice-first interface eliminates the literacy barrier, restoring confidence for vernacular users.
* **System Efficiency:** JusticeMap acts as an **Efficiency Multiplier** for human legal resources (PLVs/Lawyers). By automatically handling the administrative intake, the agent saves an estimated **50%+ of time** per client, allowing human experts to focus solely on counsel and representation.

## 2. 🏗️ Agent Architecture and Concepts Demonstrated

JusticeMap is built using a **Sequential Multi-Agent System** to ensure reliable, high-fidelity data collection. This architecture is crucial for guaranteeing data quality in a legal context.



### Core Course Concepts Implemented (50 Points)

| Course Concept | Component Name | Role in JusticeMap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Multi-Agent System** | `RootAgent` | Orchestrates the strict, sequential flow (Triage → Validate → Draft). |
| **Loop Agent** | `ValidationLoop` | **Data Quality Guarantee.** Runs an iterative loop to ensure all **critical facts** (`applicant_name`, `amount_claimed`, etc.) are present before proceeding. |
| **Custom Tools** | `generate_nalza_draft()` | **Deterministic Output.** A Python function that formats verified facts into the final, legally structured template, ensuring accuracy (not relying on the LLM for drafting). |
| **Sessions & Memory** | `InMemorySessionService` | Stores all extracted facts (`verified_facts`) in state, allowing agents to share data and pick up the conversation across turns. |
| **A2A Protocol** | Triage Agent $\leftrightarrow$ Drafting Agent | Transfers the complete, structured fact dictionary across the pipeline cleanly. |
| **LLM Agent Use** | `TriageAgent` (Gemini) | Handles the complex vernacular reasoning and empathetic conversation flow. |

## 3. ⚙️ Setup and Run Instructions

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* The `google-adk` library
* A Gemini API Key

### Execution Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL_HERE
    cd justice_map_capstone
    ```

2.  **Setup and Activate Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows command
    pip install google-adk
    ```

3.  **Set API Key (Crucial):** Set your Gemini API key as an environment variable in your terminal:
    ```powershell
    $env:GEMINI_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
    ```

4.  **Run the Agent:** Execute the test script to simulate the full sequential flow:
    ```bash
    python run_justice_map.py
    ```

### Expected Output

The script will print the conversational flow as the **Triage Agent** gathers data, followed by confirmation messages from the **Loop Agent**, and finally, the completed **`DOCUMENT_TEMPLATE`** text generated by the **Custom Tool**.
